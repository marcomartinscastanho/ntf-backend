# ntf-backend

The Django backend of the Twitter Image Scraper project.  
It manages an image gallery, serving a REST API through Django REST Framework that allows to store/access images in the gallery.

Once upon a time, it was also possible to publish images saved in the gallery to a Tumblr-like blog website, but that's no longer possible.  
Still, the code to do that was kept for purposes of future consultation.  

The purpose of this project was simply to learn and practice useful technologies.
